## Lasso

To illustrate the lasso, weâ€™ll get data from a study of factors that affect birthweight. The code chunk below loads and cleans these data, converts to factors where appropriate, and takes a sample of size 200 from the result.

```{r}
bwt_df = 
  read_csv("./extra_topic_data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    babysex = fct_recode(babysex, "male" = "1", "female" = "2"),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    frace = fct_recode(frace, "white" = "1", "black" = "2", "asian" = "3", 
                       "puerto rican" = "4", "other" = "8"),
    malform = as.logical(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    mrace = fct_recode(mrace, "white" = "1", "black" = "2", "asian" = "3", 
                       "puerto rican" = "4")) %>% 
  sample_n(200)
```
